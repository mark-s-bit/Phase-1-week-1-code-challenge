  # Description.
  This week code challenge entails the use of Javascript which has 3 Toy problems.
  We learn how to practice writing Functions and Practices 'if' and 'if...else' statement.

  # Getting Started.
  Make sure to have the following on your computer:
  1. A computer must run on (window 11,MacOS,Linux)
  2. node.js (current version)

        A > 79, B - 60 to 79, C -  59 to 49, D - 40 t
        
 # Running the application
 # grade generator
 1. run this command in terminal :
 `node gradeGenerator/index.js`
 2. it will promt you to enter the student marks.
 3. ensure number is between 0-100
 4. any number above below or above  stipulated value will bring "Invalid Grade"

 # Challenge 2: Speed Detector 
 Description: Write a program that takes as input the speed of a car e.g 80. If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.

For example, if the speed is 80, it should print: “Points: 2”. If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print: “License suspended”.

# Running the applications
## speed-detector
1. To run, run this command in terminal: 
`node speed-detector/index.js`
2. It will prompt you to enter your speed.
3. Enter your speed and press Enter.
4. Your speed will return as 'Ok' if speed is less than 70, and your speed demerits will be returned if higher than 70.

# Challenge 3: Net Salary Calculator (Toy Problem)
